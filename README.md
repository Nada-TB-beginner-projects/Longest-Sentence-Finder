## Introduction

This project is a simple JavaScript application designed to find the longest sentence from an array of sentences. The application explores different methods to achieve this goal, including using `for` loops, `while` loops, and array methods.

## Demo

No demo 

## Requirements

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Nada-TB-beginner-projects/Longest-Sentence-Finder.git

## Challenges and Learnings

1. **Retrieving and Comparing Sentence Lengths**:
   - **Challenge**: Efficiently retrieving and comparing the lengths of sentences to find the longest one.
   - **Solution**: Explored different approaches such as `for` loops, `while` loops, and array methods, gaining a deeper understanding of their respective strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Implementing Multiple Solutions**:
   - **Challenge**: Implementing multiple solutions to achieve the same goal.
   - **Solution**: Improved problem-solving skills by implementing and comparing different methods to solve the same problem.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the UI to display all sentences and highlight the longest one.
- Add more complex sentence structures and punctuation handling.
- Implement additional features such as sorting sentences by length.
